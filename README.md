# Predicting Ratings using Yelp User Review
### This was a group project completed as a course requirement for INFSCI 2915 Machine Learning
#### Other Team members: Ankur Nadda, Hearsh Mahidharia
As a complement to the course material, we wanted to explore a new area of data which was not covered in the course, "text".
YELP dataset, was chosen due to its massive size and a quantifiable factor "rating" was available to relate to the text.
